Welcome to MarsAir! This application has been developed as an exercise for candidates applying for the Quality Assurance and Testing roles at ThoughtWorks. In the same way you wouldn’t hire a musician before hearing some notes, we’d like to see you play a little bit for us. It shouldn’t take very long to finish, and we hope it is an enjoyable and challenging task.

The automation framework developed here is using Page Object Model and for TestNg for testing. Maven is used for dependency management. For testing the UI selenium is used and the language binding is Java. To execute the test we need to simply run below maven command.

mvn clean install
